// The **Command Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations. It decouples the sender of a request from the object that processes the request, and it is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to:
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.DecreaseTemperatureCommand = exports.TurnOffLightCommand = void 0;
// #### 2. **Receiver (The Actual Devices)**
// The receiver is the device being controlled by the commands. Here, we have `Light` and `Thermostat` classes.
// Receiver: Light
class Light {
    constructor() {
        this.isOn = false;
    }
    turnOn() {
        this.isOn = true;
        console.log('Light is ON');
    }
    turnOff() {
        this.isOn = false;
        console.log('Light is OFF');
    }
    getState() {
        return this.isOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF';
    }
}
// Receiver: Thermostat
class Thermostat {
    constructor() {
        this.temperature = 22; // Default temperature
    }
    increaseTemperature() {
        this.temperature += 1;
        console.log(`Temperature increased to ${this.temperature}째C`);
    }
    decreaseTemperature() {
        this.temperature -= 1;
        console.log(`Temperature decreased to ${this.temperature}째C`);
    }
    getTemperature() {
        return this.temperature;
    }
}
// #### 3. **Concrete Command Classes**
// We will create concrete command classes that encapsulate the request to execute on the receiver.
// Command: TurnOnLightCommand
class TurnOnLightCommand {
    constructor(light) {
        this.light = light;
    }
    execute() {
        this.light.turnOn();
    }
    undo() {
        this.light.turnOff();
    }
}
// Command: TurnOffLightCommand
class TurnOffLightCommand {
    constructor(light) {
        this.light = light;
    }
    execute() {
        this.light.turnOff();
    }
    undo() {
        this.light.turnOn();
    }
}
exports.TurnOffLightCommand = TurnOffLightCommand;
// Command: IncreaseTemperatureCommand
class IncreaseTemperatureCommand {
    constructor(thermostat) {
        this.thermostat = thermostat;
    }
    execute() {
        this.thermostat.increaseTemperature();
    }
    undo() {
        this.thermostat.decreaseTemperature();
    }
}
// Command: DecreaseTemperatureCommand
class DecreaseTemperatureCommand {
    constructor(thermostat) {
        this.thermostat = thermostat;
    }
    execute() {
        this.thermostat.decreaseTemperature();
    }
    undo() {
        this.thermostat.increaseTemperature();
    }
}
exports.DecreaseTemperatureCommand = DecreaseTemperatureCommand;
// #### 4. **Invoker (Command Executor)**
// The invoker class is responsible for calling the `execute()` method on the command object.
// Invoker
class RemoteControl {
    constructor() {
        this.commandHistory = [];
    }
    pressButton(command) {
        command.execute();
        this.commandHistory.push(command); // Track the history for undo/redo
    }
    undoLastCommand() {
        const lastCommand = this.commandHistory.pop();
        if (lastCommand) {
            lastCommand.undo();
        }
        else {
            console.log('No commands to undo');
        }
    }
}
// #### 5. **Client**
// Now, let's see how all these pieces fit together by simulating a client controlling devices.
// Client Code
const light = new Light();
const thermostat = new Thermostat();
const turnOnLight = new TurnOnLightCommand(light);
// const turnOffLight = new TurnOffLightCommand(light);
const increaseTemp = new IncreaseTemperatureCommand(thermostat);
// const decreaseTemp = new DecreaseTemperatureCommand(thermostat);
const remoteControl = new RemoteControl();
// Execute commands
remoteControl.pressButton(turnOnLight); // Light is ON
remoteControl.pressButton(increaseTemp); // Temperature increased to 23째C
// Undo last command (Temperature decrease)
remoteControl.undoLastCommand(); // Temperature decreased to 22째C
// Undo last command (Light off)
remoteControl.undoLastCommand(); // Light is OFF
// ### Full Power of the Command Pattern in Product-Based Environments
//
// The example above demonstrates the following key advantages of the **Command Pattern**:
//
// 1. **Encapsulation of Commands**:
// Each action (turning on/off a light, changing the temperature) is encapsulated into its own command object. This decouples the objects that initiate requests (e.g., the client or invoker) from the objects that handle the requests (e.g., the light or thermostat).
//
// 2. **Undo Capability**:
// The `undo()` method is implemented in each command class, allowing you to reverse the action. This is useful in cases where you might want to support "undo" functionality in a UI or in systems where actions need to be reversible.
//
// 3. **Flexibility**:
// You can create new command objects without changing the client or invoker code. For example, if you want to add a new device (e.g., a fan), you can create a `TurnOnFanCommand` and `TurnOffFanCommand` without altering existing code.
//
// 4. **Queuing/Batching Commands**:
// The command objects can be queued or batched, allowing you to execute a series of commands at once or execute them at a later time.
//
// 5. **Logging/Transactional Behavior**:
// By encapsulating commands as objects, you can easily log each executed command or group a set of commands into a transaction, allowing them to be executed or rolled back as a group.
//
// 6. **Separation of Concerns**:
// The sender (client or invoker) and the receiver (device) are decoupled. The sender only knows how to interact with the command interface, not the actual device. This reduces the complexity of the system and makes it more maintainable.
//
// ### Is This Enough to Cover the Full Power of the Command Pattern in Product-Based Standards?
//
//   Yes, the example above covers most of the key scenarios where the **Command Pattern** is used effectively in **product-based environments**, including:
//
//   - Encapsulation of requests and operations.
// - Undo functionality for state management.
// - Support for queuing, logging, and transactional behavior.
// - Easy extension of new commands without modifying existing code.
//
//   However, **real-world systems** may require even more complex behaviors, like:
//
// - **Composite Commands**: In real-world applications, you might have composite commands that execute multiple sub-commands at once.
// - **Asynchronous Commands**: Commands that involve async operations (e.g., network requests) can also be handled using promises or observables.
// - **Contextual Commands**: Some systems may need to pass context with each command (e.g., user credentials, transaction IDs).
//
// ### Conclusion
//
// This **Home Automation System** example gives a thorough demonstration of the **Command Pattern** and its typical use cases. It highlights how the pattern is used to encapsulate operations, queue them for delayed execution, and provide undo functionality. It also addresses important product-based concerns like flexibility, separation of concerns, and extensibility.
//
//   While there are certainly more 04 advanced-generics use cases (like asynchronous or composite commands), this example is a solid foundation and covers the core principles and advantages of the **Command Pattern** as it would be used in most real-world, product-based applications.
