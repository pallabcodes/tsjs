// ## closure
// ## closure : lexical scope decide how a variable should be looked up from a fn/nested fn
// nested/inner function have access to its parent function i.e. lexical scoping i.e. part of the closure but not what closure is
// closure is a function that has access to its parent scope, even after the parent fn has popped of from stack
// closure is created during function declaration not during when fn is being executed i.e. function invocation
