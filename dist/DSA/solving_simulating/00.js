//  # Story/Scenario: Real-time Delivery Rider Assignment
/**
 * You’re a backend engineer at a quick-commerce startup.
 * The system must assign delivery riders to orders in real-time, minimizing delivery time and balancing workload.
 * Riders can become unavailable at any moment (network loss, battery dead, etc.), and orders can be canceled or updated.
 * How do you design the assignment engine to be robust, fair, and fast?
 */
// # Breakdown / Observations (Expanded & Explicit):
// - What happens if a rider drops off mid-delivery? 
//      -> Orders assigned to that rider must be reassigned ASAP.
// - How do you rebalance orders?
//      -> When a rider drops or a new rider joins, redistribute orders to maintain balance.
// - How do you avoid starvation (some riders get all the work)?
//      -> Always assign new orders to the rider with the least workload (min-heap).
// - What if multiple orders come in at once?
//      -> Batch assignment or process sequentially, always using the heap.
// - What if an order is canceled?
//      -> Remove it from the rider's queue and update workload.
// - What if a rider returns after being unavailable?
//      -> Add them back to the heap with current workload.
// - What data structures fit best?
//      -> Min-heap for riders (by workload), hash map for order-to-rider, set for active orders.
// # Pseudocode & Planning (Literal Pseudocode)
/*
Initialize minHeap<Rider> by workload
Initialize orderToRider: Map<OrderID, RiderID>
Initialize riderToOrders: Map<RiderID, Set<OrderID>>

function assignOrder(order):
    rider = minHeap.extractMin()
    assign order to rider
    orderToRider[order.id] = rider.id
    riderToOrders[rider.id].add(order.id)
    rider.workload += 1
    minHeap.insert(rider)

function cancelOrder(orderId):
    riderId = orderToRider[orderId]
    riderToOrders[riderId].remove(orderId)
    update rider's workload in minHeap
    orderToRider.remove(orderId)

function riderUnavailable(riderId):
    orders = riderToOrders[riderId]
    for order in orders:
        assignOrder(order) // reassign
    remove rider from minHeap and riderToOrders

function riderAvailable(rider):
    minHeap.insert(rider)
    riderToOrders[rider.id] = set()


// All operations must keep heap and maps in sync
*/
// # Step-by-Step Code
// 1. Implement the min-heap for Rider objects (by workload).
// 2. Implement order assignment logic using the heap.
// 3. Implement order cancellation and rider drop-off logic.
// 4. Ensure all data structures stay in sync after each operation.
// # Reflection
// Patterns used: min-heap, hash map, event-driven design, real-time rebalancing.
// Real-world: similar to Uber Eats, Swiggy, DoorDash dispatch/assignment systems.
// How to Use This Process
// Every DSA topic (graphs, trees, DP, etc.) can be embedded in a real scenario.
// Every solution is a portfolio piece, not a throwaway.
// Every step is documented and justified, not just “code that passes.”
