# Creational Patterns: How to create an object ?

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation.

## Structural Patterns: How to modify an already created object ?

These patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures, promoting flexibility and efficiency in code.

## Behavioral Patterns: how to add / remove new behavior to an already created object ?

These patterns define how objects interact and communicate, emphasizing delegation and the flow of control between objects.

## So, yeah both structural works on created i.e. creation where behavioral works created / creational or modified / structural objects

### **Summary:**
- **Creational** patterns focus on **creating** objects.
- **Structural** patterns focus on **modifying** or **composing** already created objects.
- **Behavioral** patterns focus on **adding/removing behavior** to already created objects or how objects interact.


### **Creational Patterns: How to create an object?**

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. They focus on *how* objects are instantiated or constructed. 

**Examples**: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

### **Structural Patterns: How to modify an already created object?**

These patterns focus on the composition of objects and classes, aiming to create large structures from smaller, simpler components. They provide ways to *compose* objects and define relationships between them to promote flexibility and efficiency in code.

**Examples**: Adapter, Composite, Proxy, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight.

---

### **Behavioral Patterns: How to add/remove behavior to an already created object?**

These patterns define how objects interact and communicate, emphasizing delegation and the flow of control between objects. They focus on *what* behavior an object should have and how it can be modified dynamically.

**Examples**: Index, Index, Index, Chain of Responsibility, Index, Template Method.

This structure highlights the main distinctions: Creational deals with the creation of objects, Structural focuses on the arrangement and composition of objects, and Behavioral emphasizes how objects interact or can be modified in terms of behavior.

"search query"

just like above do the same for "prototype" pattern
is this single example  enough to cover mostly everything from real world scnario of a "prototype" pattern as per product based standards

is this enough and covers all and this is the full power of  "prototype" pattern from product based standards ?
