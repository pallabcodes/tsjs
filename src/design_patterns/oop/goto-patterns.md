# Design Patterns

## creational Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of a class is created, providing global access to that instance.
- **Factory Pattern**: Provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Provides a way to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing for more flexibility and reuse.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Creates a new object by copying an existing object, allowing for more efficient and flexible object creation.

## structural Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**: Converts the interface of a class to match another interface, allowing for compatibility between incompatible classes.
- **Bridge Pattern**: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation, allowing for more flexibility and extensibility.
- **Composite Pattern**: Combines multiple objects into a single object, allowing for more flexibility and reuse.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Dynamically adds additional responsibilities to an object without affecting its external interface.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system, hiding its internal complexity.
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common data and functionality among multiple objects.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Acts as an intermediary between a client and a real object, controlling access to the real object.

## behavioral Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Allows objects to notify each other of changes, enabling loose coupling between objects.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each algorithm in a separate object.
- **Template Method Pattern**: Provides a way to define an algorithm’s skeleton and allows subclasses to customize its behavior.
- **State Pattern**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for more flexibility and extensibility in handling requests.
- **Iterator Pattern**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.

**Note**: Two patterns can be mixed to create a hybrid pattern as required, e.g., combining **Composite** and **Decorator** patterns.
