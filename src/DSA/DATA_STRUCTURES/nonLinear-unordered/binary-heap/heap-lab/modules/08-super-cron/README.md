# 🧪 Testing Your **Super-Cron** System

To test and see your **super-cron** system in action, follow these steps:

---

## 1. 🚀 Install Dependencies

Make sure you have installed all required packages:

```sh
cd /Users/piconkayal/Projects/Personal/tsjs/src/DSA/DATA_STRUCTURES/nonLinear-unordered/binary-heap/heap-lab/modules/08-super-cron
npm install express axios cron-parser blessed
```

If using TypeScript:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @types/express @types/node @types/blessed
```

---

## 2. 📌 Check Your Entry Point

Your main entry file is `src/index.ts`. It:

* Loads jobs from `cron.json`
* Schedules them
* Starts the TUI (terminal UI)
* Starts the API server

---

## 3. 🔨 Build (if using TypeScript)

Compile your code if you're using TypeScript:

```sh
npx tsc
```

Ensure `tsconfig.json` is set to output into `dist` or a similar directory.

---

## 4. ▶️ Run the Scheduler

For development (recommended):

```sh
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

Or, if you've compiled to JavaScript:

```sh
node dist/src/index.js
```

---

## 5. 🖥️ See the TUI

* The terminal UI should now appear, showing scheduled tasks and their ETA.
* Logs will be visible as tasks execute (e.g., email, log, or API ping).

---

## 6. 🌐 Test the API

Use `curl` or Postman to interact with the API (default port `3000`):

### ✅ List all jobs:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/jobs
```

### ➕ Add a new job:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/job \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"test-job","taskType":"log","scheduleMode":"interval","intervalMs":5000,"priority":1,"payload":{"message":"Hello from API!"}}'
```

---

## 7. 👀 Watch for Output

* Terminal output will confirm task executions.
* The TUI updates every second with ETA and status info.

---

## 8. 🧯 Troubleshooting

* **Missing modules?** Run `npm install`.
* **TS errors?** Check `tsconfig.json`, type imports, and file structure.
* **TUI not showing?** Ensure your terminal supports it (avoid restricted shells).
