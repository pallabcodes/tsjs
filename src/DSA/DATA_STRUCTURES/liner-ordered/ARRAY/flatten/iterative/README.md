# Initial prompt of any question (after getting the idea)

Given an array that can be n level deep (if nothing think +Infinity) and prohitibited to use recursion , how to solve it ?

N.B: Do not write or jump into any code

Let's brain storm first

Looking at it , I wanna use while loop and with that since it has an order to maintain so I am thinking stack, queue or linkedList

my initital though to use stack and stack only

then I though of what If I can smartly use queue first then stack

or maybe I somehow use stack or queue along with a linkedList

N.B: I don't care about efficiency or optimization right now, just follow my trail of through, help me brainstorm
